You've just watched [_American Hospitals_](https://fixithealthcare.com/), and you might be left scratching your head.

That was a lot of information!

Congratulations. You've just learned more about the health care system than most people in the United States.

In fact, you've learned more than most people in the United States who work in the health care system.

You've learned that the health care system is a complex system of incentives and information asymmetry between patients, providers (doctors and hospitals), payors (insurance companies), and the local, state, and federal governments.

As you absorb the information in the film, you might be left wondering:

- How can I use this information to help myself?

- How can I use this information to help my family?

- How can I use this information to help my community?

As a first step, consider the goals of Healthy California, which is founded on the principles that healthcare is a human right, and that publicly financed guaranteed health care — care with a single standard for all residents of California — is critical to our state’s social and economic well-being.

Next, check out this map:

{% maps 
   src="cms_hospital_info.html" /%}

This map shows every hospital in each in California and the rest of the country as defined by the federal government using [this data](https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/dataset/xubh-q36u).

The map includes metrics of hospital quality released by the federal government, so you can see the quality of care in your community and use these metrics to inform decision-making.

The map is interactive. You can click on a hospital to see more information about it, such as these quality metrics.

We are working on adding pricing information from hospitals to better help you make decisions that affect your health or the health of those around you. For now, we have 4000+ hospitals` price sheets collected at [https://data.payless.health/](https://data.payless.health/) which you can search by hospital CMS Certification Number (CCN, which you can look up here - [https://data.cms.gov/tools/medicare-inpatient-hospital-look-up-tool](https://data.cms.gov/tools/medicare-inpatient-hospital-look-up-tool)).
