You've just watched _American Hospitals_, and you might be left scratching your head.

That was a lot of information!

Congratulations. You've just learned more about the health care system than most people in the United States.

In fact, you've learned more than most people in the United States who work in the health care system.

You've learned that the health care system is a complex system of incentives and information asymmetry between patients, providers (doctors and hospitals), payors (insurance companies), and the local, state, and federal governments.

As you absorb the information in the film, you might be left wondering:

- How can I use this information to help myself?

- How can I use this information to help my family?

- How can I use this information to help my community?

As a first step, consider the goals of Healthy California, which is founded on the principles that healthcare is a human right, and that publicly financed guaranteed health care — care with a single standard for all residents of California — is critical to our state’s social and economic well-being.

Next, check out this map:

TODO(mictadiello,jaanli): Add map

This map shows every hospital in each in California as defined by the federal government using this data: https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/dataset/xubh-q36u. 

The map is color-coded by hospital quality metrics released by the State of California. 

Green means the hospital is in the top 10% of hospitals in the state.

Yellow means the hospital is in the top 25% of hospitals in the state.

Red means the hospital is in the bottom 25% of hospitals in the state.

The map is interactive. You can click on a hospital to see more information about it.

This data is available for download here: https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/california-hospital-inpatient-mortality-rates-and-quality-ratings and is released by the California Health and Human Services Agency whose goals are to "spark innovation, promote research and economic opportunities, engage public participation in government, increase transparency, and inform decision-making."

This map can enable you to:

* see the quality of care in your community, as determined by the State of California.

We are working on adding pricing information from hospitals to better help you make decisions that affect your health or the health of those around you.
