1. **Take a Pause**  
Before taking any action, allocate time to process your emotions. Permit yourself the space to grieve, cry, and experience all the overwhelming feelings that come with a life-altering cancer diagnosis.

2. **Find a Support System**  
Cancer can be emotionally and logistically draining. Don't navigate your diagnosis or treatment alone. Engage a support person – a trusted friend, family member, or patient advocate – who can assist you in navigating the process by researching physicians, formulating questions, attending appointments with you (via phone or teleconferencing if necessary), taking notes, and organizing paperwork.

3. **Do Your Research**  
Being informed will help you better understand your diagnosis and feel more prepared to make decisions about your care. Spend time researching your diagnosis and local doctors who specialize in your type of cancer. It's especially important to identify specialists for rare cancer types, as they could benefit from a doctor familiar with that specific diagnosis.

But remember to exercise caution when conducting your research. Consult only reputable sources (such as Cancer.gov, the American Cancer Society, and academic institutions). Keep in mind that statistics represent averages, not individuals. Each person with a cancer diagnosis has their unique experience and circumstances.

4. **Seek a Second (or Even Third) Opinion**  
Before beginning treatment, consider seeking multiple opinions from different medical professionals. This approach ensures the backing of more than one expert; a second opinion can also provide peace of mind when making treatment decisions. It's beneficial for your care team to be aware of your intention to seek another opinion. If you're hesitant to share with your doctors that you're seeking another opinion, remember that it's common practice. Many doctors welcome the input of other medical professionals.

5. **Get Organized**  
You'll receive a lot of paperwork, including copies of test results, medical visit summaries, bills, and insurance statements. Find an effective method to organize all this information before it accumulates. This way, you can easily access medical records and manage insurance and billing.

6. **Take Care of Your Emotional Wellbeing**  
Your emotional wellbeing can easily be neglected when focusing on physical health and dealing with the logistics of cancer treatment. However, it's easy to get overwhelmed, so ensure to attend to your emotional needs as well. Join support groups, exercise, practice mindfulness, or see a therapist regularly – whatever is necessary to maintain your mental health.

7. **Set Boundaries**  
Taking care of your emotional wellbeing also involves setting boundaries around discussions related to your cancer diagnosis and experience. When I was diagnosed with stage-4 breast cancer, I was surprised by the volume of misguided or inappropriate comments from well-meaning individuals who didn't understand my situation. These comments ranged from sharing stories of friends with the same type of cancer who had poor outcomes to suggesting miracle cures. While not always negative, these comments often placed the emotional burden on me to respond to a sensitive topic. It's perfectly acceptable to politely shut down these conversations; find a way to inform people offering unsolicited advice that you're working with your care team to determine the best treatment for you, and leave it at that.

The initial few weeks post a cancer diagnosis can be stressful and frightening. Self-care, proactiveness, being well-informed, and surrounding yourself with a support system – be it family, friends, a support group, or a patient advocate – can make this period significantly less stressful.
