## Contributing to Help Pages
**Let's harness community wisdom to create an open-source treasure trove of health care know-how**



Welcome, health care adventurers, to the Payless Health Help Pages! We're on a mission to make navigating health care systems easier, and we need your help!

As a nonprofit organization, we're all about transforming health care access and efficiency using open-source artificial intelligence. Our buddies at the National Institutes of Health and Harvard Medical School help us build, train, and deploy our AI engine, ClinicalBERT, which is a pretty big deal. But we can't do it alone – that's where you come in!

The Help Pages are an empowering, educational collection of resources created by you – our fantastic community of experts. There are many reasons why your contributions matter. Here are a few that align with our values:

>
> When you contribute to our Help Pages, you're not only helping yourself – you're helping others, too! By sharing your know-how, you're creating a valuable, free resource for everyone to access and enjoy.

## Share Your Expertise for Self-Advocacy Success ##
We're excited to have you contribute and are here to help guide you in the right direction. Right now, there's some specific material we're particularly interested in.

We're on the lookout for guidance on the basics of self-advocacy in health care from both everyday patients and expert advocates (and we know that sometimes, you're both!). We want to share the methods, tips, and tricks you've discovered that can empower people to make their voices heard, navigate the health care system like pros, and become their own health care heroes.


***Here's what we're looking for***:

> **Self-Advocacy 101:** Share the essential self-advocacy strategies that every health care adventurer should know. What are the key principles or mindsets helped you or those you've worked with?
>
> **Effective Advocacy Techniques:** What are the specific techniques and approaches you've used or guided others to use in advocating for themselves in various health care situations? What strategies have you found most effective in overcoming challenges and ensuring optimal care, without getting too case-specific?
>
> **Dealing with Health Care Professionals:** How do you build effective relationships with health care providers while standing up for your needs and rights, or coaching others to do so? How do you build partnerships with those professionals? Share your secrets to communication and collaboration success.
>
> **Making It Accessible:** Let’s make health care a breeze for everyone. When sharing your experiences and advice, please organize your material in a straightforward manner with plain language so that it's accessible to the broadest possible audience.

We can't wait to learn from your expertise, techniques, and experiences, and to share your wisdom with the Payless Health community. Let’s educate each other to become self-advocacy champions!
